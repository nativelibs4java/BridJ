BridJ 0.6 (20111107, commit 4950e5c58f32869ce460dbbc59fe969865dd9288)

- Added errno/GetLastError() mechanism : declare methods to throw org.bridj.LastError and it's all handled automatically (issue #74)
- Added protected mode (-Dbridj.protected=true / BRIDJ_PROTECTED=1), to prevent native crashes (makes BridJ bindings slower + disables optimized raw calls).
- Added proxy-based Objective-C delegates support (forwards unknown methods to a Java instance) (issue #188)
- Added Objective-C 2.0 blocks support (similar to callbacks, inherit from ObjCBlock instead of Callback) (issue #192)
- Added Pointer.asList() and .asList(ListType) to get a List view of the pointed memory 
	- depending on the ListType, the view can be mutable / resizeable
	- removed the List interface from Pointer (which is now just an Iterable)
	- added Pointer.allocateList(type, capacity) to create a NativeList from scratch (has a .getPointer method to grab the resulting memory at the end)
- Added Pointer.moveBytesTo(Pointer)
- Added support for embedded libraries extraction from "lib/arch" paths (along with "org/bridj/lib/arch", where arch uses BridJ's convention)

- Added support for multiarch Linux distributions (issue #2)
- Added support for versioned library file names (issue #72)
- Added global allocated memory alignment setting (BRIDJ_DEFAULT_ALIGNMENT env. var. & bridj.defaultAlignment property), + Pointer.allocateAlignedArray
- Added basic calls log mechanism (disables direct mode) : -Dbridj.logCalls=true or BRIDJ_LOG_CALLS=1 (only logs the method name & signature, not the arguments or returned values)
- Added BridJ.setMinLogLevel(Level) (issue #190)
- Added Platform.addEmbeddedLibraryResourceRoot(root) to use & customize the embedded library extraction feature in user projects
- Added support for packed structs (@Struct(pack = 1), or any other pack value)
- Added check of BridJ environment variables and Java properties : if any BRIDJ_* env. var. or bridj.* property does not exist, it will log warnings + full list of valid options
- Added @JNIBound annotation to mark native methods that should not be bound by BridJ but by plain old JNI
- Fixed Pointer.next/.offset methods (used to throw errors a the end of iteration)
- Fixed Pointer.getNativeObjectAtOffset(long byteOffset, Type type)
- Fixed struct fields implemented as Java fields
- Fixed resolution of MacOS X "ApplicationServices" framework binaries, such as CoreGraphics

- Fixed crash during deallocation of Callbacks + fixed leak of Callbacks (now need to retain a reference to callbacks or use BridJ.protectFromGC / unprotectFromGC)
- Made the StructIO customization mechanism more flexible
- Made JawtLibrary public
- Various Javadoc tweaks
