[BridJ](http://bridj.googlecode.com) is a Java / native interoperability library that focuses on speed and ease of use.

It is similar in spirit to [JNA](https://github.com/twall/jna) (dynamic bindings that don't require any native compilation, unlike JNI), but was designed to support C++, to be blazing fast (thanks to [dyncall](http://dyncall.org) + hand-optimized assembly tweaks) and to use modern Java features.

A comprehensive documentation is available on its [Wiki](https://code.google.com/p/bridj/wiki/FAQ?tm=6).

It was previously hosted on [ochafik/nativelibs4java](http://github.com/ochafik/nativelibs4java).
