== Projects Used

BridJ uses the following libraries :
  * http://dyncall.org[dyncall], an excellent lightweight FFI library distributed under http://dyncall.org/license.shtml[an ISC-style license] (reproduced below).
  Daniel Adler and Tassilo Philipp (authors of http://dyncall.org/[dyncall]) have been very supportive and kindly accepted and/or adapted most if not all of the patches I submitted to them, many thanks !
  To patch dyncall with BridJ's modifications, type :
{{{
wget http://nativelibs4java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/libraries/BridJ/admin/patch_dyncall.sh
bash patch_dyncall.sh dyncall
}}}
  * http://asm.ow2.org/[ASM], a Java code generation library distributed under http://asm.ow2.org/license.html[a 3-clauses BSD-style license] (reproduced below).

Note that BridJ ships with these libraries, so you don't need to put them in the path or install them to your system : *BridJ's JAR file is self-contained.*
